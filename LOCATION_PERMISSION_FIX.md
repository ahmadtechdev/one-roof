# Location Permission Fix for Google Play Console

## Issue Description
The app was rejected by Google Play Console due to missing prominent disclosure for the `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission. Google Play requires apps to provide a prominent disclosure dialog before requesting location permissions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Permission Handler Package
- Added `permission_handler: ^11.3.1` to `pubspec.yaml`
- This package provides proper permission handling for Flutter apps

### 2. Created Prominent Disclosure Dialog
- **File**: `lib/widgets/location_permission_dialog.dart`
- **Purpose**: Shows a prominent disclosure dialog before requesting location permissions
- **Features**:
  - Clear explanation of why location permission is needed
  - Detailed list of features that require location access
  - Privacy information about data usage
  - Professional UI with proper styling

### 3. Created Location Permission Service
- **File**: `lib/services/location_permission_service.dart`
- **Purpose**: Centralized service for handling location permissions
- **Features**:
  - Checks permission status
  - Handles permission requests with proper disclosure
  - Provides user feedback through snackbars
  - Handles permission denial scenarios

### 4. Updated MapScreen Implementations
- **Files**: 
  - `lib/views/hotel/search_hotels/hotel_info/hotel_info.dart`
  - `lib/views/hotel/search_hotels/search_hotel.dart`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added permission checks before showing Google Maps
  - Integrated prominent disclosure dialog
  - Proper error handling for denied permissions

### 5. Created Privacy Disclosure Dialog
- **File**: `lib/widgets/privacy_disclosure_dialog.dart`
- **Purpose**: Shows privacy policy and data usage information
- **Features**:
  - Detailed explanation of data collection
  - Information about data protection measures
  - User agreement acknowledgment

### 6. Updated App Home Widget
- **File**: `lib/widgets/app_home.dart`
- **Purpose**: Shows privacy disclosure on first app launch
- **Features**:
  - Checks if user has seen privacy disclosure
  - Shows disclosure dialog on first launch
  - Stores acknowledgment in SharedPreferences

### 7. Updated Main App
- **File**: `lib/main.dart`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added imports for new widgets and services
  - Updated home widget to use AppHome

## Compliance with Google Play Requirements

### Prominent Disclosure Requirements Met:
1. **Clear Purpose**: Dialog clearly explains why location permission is needed
2. **User-Friendly**: Dialog is easy to understand and visually appealing
3. **Prominent Display**: Dialog is shown before any location permission request
4. **Detailed Information**: Includes specific use cases for location data
5. **Privacy Information**: Explains data usage and protection measures

### Permission Flow:
1. User taps on location/map feature
2. App checks if location permission is granted
3. If not granted, shows prominent disclosure dialog
4. User can accept or deny the permission
5. If accepted, requests location permission
6. Provides feedback on permission status

## Files Modified/Created:

### New Files:
- `lib/widgets/location_permission_dialog.dart`
- `lib/services/location_permission_service.dart`
- `lib/widgets/privacy_disclosure_dialog.dart`
- `lib/widgets/app_home.dart`
- `LOCATION_PERMISSION_FIX.md`

### Modified Files:
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added permission_handler dependency
- `lib/main.dart` - Updated imports and home widget
- `lib/views/hotel/search_hotels/hotel_info/hotel_info.dart` - Added permission handling
- `lib/views/hotel/search_hotels/search_hotel.dart` - Added permission handling

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test the app on a fresh installation
2. Verify that privacy disclosure appears on first launch
3. Test location permission flow when accessing hotel maps
4. Verify that permission denial is handled gracefully
5. Test on different Android versions (API 29+ for background location)

## Next Steps:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to install new dependencies
2. Test the app thoroughly
3. Build and upload to Google Play Console
4. The app should now pass the prominent disclosure requirement

## Additional Notes:
- The background location permission is properly declared in AndroidManifest.xml
- The app now provides clear, prominent disclosure before requesting location permissions
- All location-related features are properly gated behind permission checks
- Privacy policy information is provided to users upfront
